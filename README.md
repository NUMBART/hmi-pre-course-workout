# Pre-Course Workout Plan
Mountaineering is a combination of physical, mental and psychological strength as well as endurance. Every visit to the mountain is different. Do not take the mountains and altitude for granted.

Your instructors and batch mates are your family – remember that mountaineering is all about teamwork. Conditions are harsh and the right attitude is imperative to enjoy all the adventure you will experience.

This course is intense and rigorous and will test you. You must love the mountains, your people and adventure to enjoy this course. This is a preparatory plan for you.

We assume that you live an active lifestyle which includes easy to moderate levels of exercise of at least an hour on a daily basis.

This is 12 week workout plan with **6 days of training per week.**

**Proper Nutrition and Recovery (Rest)** is just as important as working out – so please ensure that you get 7 to 8 hours of sound sleep every night accompanied by good sports nutrition. Your body will need it. Feel free to play around with the rest of the day depending on your convenience.

**All Workouts will start with a proper Warm up (Dynamic Stretches). This will be followed by the Main Workout and concluded with a proper Cool down (Static Stretches).**

This programme attempts to initiate you into a training regime that will assist you in enjoying the rigor & discipline of the mountaineering courses.

Before you start any exercise program please consult a Doctor to make sure you are fit to carry on with the exercise plan.

Perform the exercise with proper form and technique accompanied with proper nutrition and rest. (Keep yourself optimally hydrated during workout).

Exercise should help us to become more functional and fit and not vice-versa.

**In order to meet the requisite standards of HMI fitness level if you have little or no experience of any form of exercise its recommended you start this workout plan as soon as possible, at least 4 months before your course starts and even individuals with experience in exercise can start as early as possible.**

**For those who already workout and have access to gym  may continue with their workout routine but please make sure that below listed exercises are also included in your daily workout plan and individuals who already lift weights can lift heavier (with proper form and technique) than recommended in the workout plan.**  
  
  

|Warm Up (Dynamic Stretches) | Main Workout | Cooldown
|---|---|---|
| Perform it at the beginning of every workout session. Perform it until you feel warmed up but don’t get exhausted while performing it.| Perform weights and cardio every alternate day. Perform with correct form and technique. Keep yourself properly hydrated during workout. If you can perform more repetitions, sets and lift more weights then please carry on and if you can jog for longer please go ahead. | Perform 2 sets of every stretch soon after workout. Make sure you hold every stretch for a minimum of 30 sec. Make sure you feel the stretch but if the stretch hurts stop it right away and do not force yourself, instead try to better it slowly with every performance. |
